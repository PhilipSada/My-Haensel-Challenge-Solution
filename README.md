# My Solution to the Haensel Frontend Working Student Challenge

This is my solution to the Haensel Recruitment Challenge for the Frontend WerkStudent/Working Student. This challenge was given to test my understanding and ability to combine some of the technologies the company is using to create Web-UI applications

## Technologies used 

This project uses technologies such as Bootstrap, Dj3 and Netlify. Bootstrap and Dj3 were required to solve the challenge. Netlify was used to host the website which contains the solution to the challenge thereby making it easy to view the website on any device.

## Task Completed
I was able to modify a bootstrap example to embed a d3.js histogram in a simple HTML page, according to a given design. A diagram and hints were provided to have a clear picture of the task.
